            <h3>Dear Friends,</h3>
            <p>On Tuesday, January 7, 2025, our lives were turned upside down when the Altadena Eaton fire swept through our community, leaving us without a home and neighborhood. This has been an incredibly challenging time for our family, friends and colleagues as we all work to rebuild what we’ve lost.</p>

            <p>Our son Eden is enrolled at Altadena Elementary School, which is also in the affected area. The school itself was apparently spared but is currently closed since it is located in the middle of a devastated neighborhood, and it may take a while before it can reopen again, if it does. Many of the staff, teachers, and students, including numerous Eden's classmates who live in that area have also been impacted. Eden's teacher lost her house, and her children's school is no more. The preschool Eden attended when his elementary school was closed has also been destroyed. Our house, while still miraculously standing, is on a property that was ravaged by the fire. Our landlord’s house was completely destroyed and served as one of the last barriers against the fire. This is reportedly where firefighters managed to contain the blaze, preventing it from spreading further west and south.</p>

            <p>We were incredibly fortunate to retrieve a few belongings we had left behind. However, while our house is still standing, it is unclear at this time whether we will be able to retrieve everything, live there again one day and how soon. Although we are lucky enough to stay with friends and have our vital and basic needs met, our renter status means the costs for temporary housing won't be covered by insurance. Our beloved neighborhood where we have been living for more than 8 years, and where our 5-year-old son was born and raised, will never be the same. The future remains uncertain for us at the moment. Day after day, we are hearing from friends and colleagues who lost everything fleeing the fire in the middle of the night or pre-dawn. Some of them almost got trapped in the flames and could have died. We are heartbroken by this tragedy and want to do our part and do everything we can to help, support and rebuild this wonderful community.</p>

            <p>This is why we are reaching out to ask for your support as we navigate this difficult journey. We are very capable people, usually reluctant to ask for help, but we need to set our pride aside for once, because so many people around us are impacted that no help is too small. Donations will go directly toward helping us mitigate the increase in expenses we are facing in the coming months and helping our Altadena community to heal and rebuild. Our top priority is our son Eden's well-being, and any donations will assist in giving him back a sense of normalcy as soon as possible. Once our situation is somewhat stabilized, we will do whatever we can to help the people who need it the most. It will take years to rebuild, so nothing is too small.</p>

            <p>Any contribution, no matter the size, will make a meaningful impact, bring us one step closer to regaining stability, and give us some strength and leverage to help our neighbors, friends, and members of the Altadena community who need it the most.</p>

            <p>If you’re unable to donate, sharing our story with your network would mean the world to us. We are still in the middle of sorting things out and securing daycare for Eden, but we will try to share more details and updates as we go on this website: <a href="https://mygouf.github.io">https://mygouf.github.io</a>. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for standing by us during this difficult time.</p>

            <p>With love and gratitude, <br>Marie Ygouf, Pierrick Guyard, and our son Eden</p>

            <h3>Chers amis,</h3>
            <p>Le mardi 7 janvier 2025, nos vies ont basculé lorsque l’incendie d’Altadena Eaton a ravagé notre communauté, nous laissant sans maison ni quartier. Cette période est incroyablement difficile pour notre famille, nos amis et nos collègues, alors que nous nous efforçons tous de reconstruire ce que nous avons perdu.</p>

            <p>Notre fils Éden est inscrit à l'école publique élémentaire d'Altadena, qui se trouve également dans la zone sinistrée. L'école elle-même a apparemment été épargnée mais reste actuellement fermée, car elle est située au cœur d'un quartier dévasté, et il faudra du temps avant qu'elle puisse ouvrir à nouveau, si elle rouvre un jour, la situation financière des écoles publiques étant difficile ici...</p>
